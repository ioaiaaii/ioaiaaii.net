# ADR #001: Selecting Squarespace for Domain Registration

## Context
We need a domain registrar for `ioaiaaii.net`.

## Decision
We will use **Squarespace** to register and manage our domain.

## Options Considered
- **Squarespace**: Simple, user-friendly domain registration and DNS management, competitive pricing, free WHOIS privacy, and future-proof given the Google Domains transition.
- **Google Domains**: Tight GCP integration, transparent pricing. However, transitioning to Squarespace, leading to uncertainty in long-term support.
- **Namecheap** & **GoDaddy**: Offer similar domain services but include more features than needed or upselling of additional services.

## Rationale
- **Usage**: Simple DNS management and setup.
- **Pricing**: Clear costs with free privacy protection.

## Consequences
- **Pros**: Fast setup, transparent pricing, adequate DNS features, and cheaper.
- **Cons**: Fewer advanced DNS features than other registrars but sufficient for current needs.

## Decision Status
- **Accepted**: We will proceed with Squarespace for domain registration and DNS management for 1 year, and re-evaluate.
