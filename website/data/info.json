    "profile": "Computer Engineer and Composer dedicated to building sustainable systems and exploring the intersection of technology and art. Experienced in managing large-scale production infrastructures with a focus on observability and performance while cultivating a culture of respect and collaboration.",
    "artistBio": "Composer drawing on quantum and distributed computing principles to interpret relativistic reality and explore soundscapes driven by warped motion dynamics. Discography with record labels including Anopolis, June, Lower Parts, and Phormix. Member of UNIX SYSTEMS group. Performs live with synthesizers under an improvisational approach.",
    "engineerBio": "Computer Engineer dedicated to building sustainable systems. Experienced in Site Reliability Engineering, managing large-scale production infrastructures, focusing on observability and performance while cultivating a culture of respect and collaboration. Currently, pursuing a Master's in Quantum Computing, exploring advanced computational methods.",
    "artisticApproach": "Drawing from a Computer Engineering background, emerged into music, experimenting with the concept of 'Tensor Music'. An approach that explores vector spaces and their interactions, with linear algebra shaping musical interactions as multidimensional spaces. Currently focused on 'Superluminal Motion', inspired by theoretical faster-than-light phenomena, where spacetime intersects across past, present, and future states, creating an emotionally warped drive.",
