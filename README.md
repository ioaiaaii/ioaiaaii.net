# ioaiaaii.net

So, this is an over-engineered website :).
Wanted to gather my work from here and there and to maintain a project for experiments.
This is a BFF, with Vue.js and Go backend, engineered using Clean Architecture and adhering to SRE principles.

## System Design and API Spec

Specifics about the system engineering with API doc with [OpenAPI Spec](./docs/api/README.md) and [Architecture](./docs/desing/system-architecture.md).

![Architecture](./docs/desing/diagram_v1.svg)

## ADRs

Keeping (at least) the most [important decisions](./docs/adr/) in specific format.

## Release Engineering

### Repo Operator

Port [repo-operator](https://github.com/ioaiaaii/repo-operator) as submodule, and use ready non-local config, and makefiles.
All workflows are using reproducible and hermetic builds, to support all CI/CD operations, from repo-operator. Few makefile targets with `local-*` prefix, are fow specific local dev help.

### CI

### Linting

- Lint with golang-ci, and use GH Workflows caching for quick run
- Lint vue.js TBD

### Testing

- Unit-testing TBD
- Smoke/Functional TBD

### Security

- Scan with Trivy
- Cache Trivy-DB with GH

### Packaging

- Multistage builds
- Use Distrolles
- Layers serialization with diff priority
- Cache where possible
- Lint with Harodlint:

    ```json
    [{"code":"DL3006","column":1,"file":"-","level":"warning","line":1,"message":"Always tag the version of an image explicitly"},{"code":"DL3015","column":1,"file":"-","level":"info","line":2,"message":"Avoid additional packages by specifying `--no-install-recommends`"},{"code":"DL3009","column":1,"file":"-","level":"info","line":2,"message":"Delete the apt-get lists after installing something"},{"code":"SC2154","column":1,"file":"-","level":"warning","line":2,"message":"node_verion is referenced but not assigned (did you mean 'node_version'?)."},{"code":"DL3045","column":1,"file":"-","level":"warning","line":4,"message":"`COPY` to a relative destination without `WORKDIR` set."},{"code":"DL3003","column":1,"file":"-","level":"warning","line":5,"message":"Use WORKDIR to switch to a directory"},{"code":"DL3016","column":1,"file":"-","level":"warning","line":5,"message":"Pin versions in npm. Instead of `npm install <package>` use `npm install <package>@<version>`"},{"code":"DL3011","column":1,"file":"-","level":"error","line":8,"message":"Valid UNIX ports range from 0 to 65535"}]make: *** [image-lint] Error 1
    ```

### Build

- Use kaniko with caching remote repo

    Currently around 1-2m to build and push

- Build efficiency check with dive

    ```shell
    Image Source: docker://europe-west3-docker.pkg.dev/micro-infra/micro-repo/ioaiaaii:v1.1.9
    Fetching image... (this can take a while for large images)
    Analyzing image...
    efficiency: 99.9943 %
    wastedBytes: 1513 bytes (1.5 kB)
    userWastedPercent: 0.0079 %
    Inefficient Files:
    Count  Wasted Space  File Path
        2         900 B  /etc/passwd
        2         613 B  /usr/lib/os-release
        2           0 B  /tmp
        2           0 B  /root
    Results:
    PASS: highestUserWastedPercent
    PASS: highestWastedBytes
    PASS: lowestEfficiency
    Result:PASS [Total:3] [Passed:3] [Failed:0] [Warn:0] [Skipped:0]
    ```

## CD

- In context of delivery, an [ArgoCD ApplicationSet](https://github.com/ioaiaaii/micro-infra/blob/main/gitops/domain/continues-delivery.yaml) with `pullRequest` generator is monitoring for PRs, with the gh label `preview.

- In the context of deployment, an [ArgoCD Application](https://github.com/ioaiaaii/micro-infra/blob/main/gitops/domain/continues-delivery.yaml) listens to new tags and deploys.

## Releasing

- progressive releasing to be evaluated with [kargo](https://kargo.io/)
- using tracing and slos, to evaluate canarying with argo rollouts.
- currently:
    1. check latest upstream tag and select the new vX.X.X
    2. bump helm chart appVersion to new tag vX.X.X
    3. after merge, head to master and cut a tag with `git tag vX.X.X
    4. workflows will deliver the new image, argo will deploy it
    5. workflows will publish a new release, with conventional commit spec:

        <a name="v1.1.7"></a>
        ## [v1.1.7] - 2024-11-15
        ### üêõ Bug Fixes
        - **website:** image path for dec-pdc

        ### üõ†Ô∏è Chores
        - **deploy:** bump chart appversion
        - **iac:** module update with new images

        ### Pull Requests
        - Merge pull request [#41](https://github.com/ioaiaaii/ioaiaaii.net/issues/41) from ioaiaaii/chore/images-improvements
        - Merge pull request [#40](https://github.com/ioaiaaii/ioaiaaii.net/issues/40) from ioaiaaii/chore/images-improvements
        - Merge pull request [#39](https://github.com/ioaiaaii/ioaiaaii.net/issues/39) from ioaiaaii/chore/images-improvements

## Observability

### Logs

Currently, using `slog`, with the toleration, if otel collector is not up, to print structured logs to stdout.
Otherwise, logger provider pushes logs to otel collector.
In terms of logging, better to log only errors or super helpful debug/info paths.

### Metrics

Currently, otelfiber is ready for network related metrics.
Only added go performance metrics for now.
Check exemplars in the future.

### Traces

Otelfabric handles tracing, we just use the tracer provider with context.

3. `local-dev` simply runs both components in different reported ports.
4. have fun :beer
